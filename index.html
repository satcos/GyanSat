								<p>Isolated remains of Homo erectus in Hathnora in the Narmada Valley in central India indicate that India might have been inhabited since at least somewhere between 500,000 and 200,000 years ago.</p>
								<p>Linguists hypothesized that Dravidian-speaking people were spread throughout the Indian subcontinent before a series of Indo-Aryan migrations. In this view, the early Indus Valley civilisation is often identified as having been Dravidian. Cultural and linguistic similarities have been cited by researchers for a proto-Dravidian origin of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation. Scholars like J. Bloch and M. Witzel believe that the Indo-Aryans moved into an already Dravidian speaking area after the oldest parts of the Rig Veda were already composed. Dravidian languages were belived to be formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming Indo-Aryan languages.</p>

									<p>There were three Sangam periods, namely Head Sangam, Middle Sangam and Last Sangam period. The Sangam literature is thought to have been produced in three Sangam academies of each period. The evidence on the early history of the Tamil kingdoms consists of the epigraphs of the region, the Sangam literature, and archaeological data.</p>

									<p>Some of the earliest temples that are still standing were built during this period by the Pallavas. The rock-cut temples in Mamallapuram and the majestic Kailasanatha and Vaikuntaperumal temples of Kanchipuram stand testament to the Pallava art. The Cholas, built long-lasting stone temples including the great Brihadisvara temple of Thanjavur. Temples dedicated to Siva and Vishnu received liberal donations of money, jewels, animals, and land, and thereby became powerful economic institutions.</p>

									<p>Angkor Wat is a temple complex in Cambodia and the largest religious monument in the world, on a site measuring 162.6 hectares. The initial design and construction of the temple took place in the first half of the 12th century, during the reign of Suryavarman II. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. It has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on its national flag, and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.</p>
